Simple BMI app for HSE workshop (see Readme)

Below we create a new class to find easily how current BMI corresponds to categories.
In Constants below we create a variable called bmi_info with a set of BMI objects:
each object has a name (underweight, normal, overweight etc.), lower and upper boundary (left, right)
and alert property - to show a bootstrap alert of corresponding color.
It also has an additional method called check_if_in - when you pass a value there it returns itself, if the value
is between lower and upper value, or None if it isn't. 
That is not the most efficient way of dealing with such kind of tasks but again for didactic reasons can be helpful 
to understand how and why classes are used.
